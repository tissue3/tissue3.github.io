Hi, nice to meet you! I am Zhijing Li, a 3rd year Phd student in electrical and computer engineering (ECE) department, Cornell University. 

I am advised by Prof. [Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) in [Capra](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/) research group. I worked on [image compression for deep neural networks applications](https://github.com/cucapra/ImageNetV2/tree/master/jpeg_eval), and contributed to [Dahlia](https://github.com/cucapra/dahlia) and [FuTil](https://github.com/cucapra/futil). My current research focus is on programming languages and compilers for designing hardware accelerators, where I designed [EQueue dialect](https://github.com/cucapra/event_queue) in [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) and [Magnolia](https://github.com/tissue3/cornell_note/blob/master/configurable_fpga_dnn/proposal.pdf). 

Before coming to Cornell, I worked on approximate computing and stochastic computing with Prof. [Weikang Qian](http://umji.sjtu.edu.cn/~wkqian/people/weikang-qian.html) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
